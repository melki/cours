.SH NAME
tile \- split a text file up into small related pieces called tiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
tile [-oiv] [-b bound] [-n numiter] [-k kval] [-w wnum] [-p nopara] file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The tile command is used to partition a document into a set of
related pieces called tiles.  The main purpose of this is to allow
a finer granularity of indexing.  Software that usually indexes documents
or pages by words can now use this software to break the document up into
smaller elements of related information (tiles) and index into that.
The algorithm that determines the tiles in a document is essentially
statistical in nature and is described in a paper by Marti Hearst
entitled "Multi-Paragraph Segmentation of Expository Discourse", available
from the U.C Berkeley Computer Science Division.  A copy of that paper
has been included with the source for the tile program.
.LP
.B Overview
.sp
.LP
By default, the files are broken up into tiles and the tiles
are displayed by surrounding each with the following meta information:
.sp
.nf
	<TILE \fItilenum\fP - FILE: \fIfilename\fP START: \fIstartoff\fP END: \fIendoff\fP>
	document tile
	</TILE \fItilenum\fP - FILE: \fIfilename\fP START: \fIstartoff\fP END: \fIendoff\fP>
.sp
.fi
where \fItilenum\fP is the tile number, \fIfilename\fP is the name of the
file the tile comes from, \fIstartoff\fP and \fIendoff\fP are the starting
and endind file offsets of the tile.
.LP
If the -o flag is specified, then simply a list of file offsets for each
tile is printed, along with a self-expanatory header identifying where
the tiles come from.
.LP
.B Identifying Paragraphs
.LP
By default, the tileing tokenizer will identify paragraph breaks by
the presence of one or more blank lines.  If the text uses indented
paragraphs instead of blank lines, you can specify the -i flag so the
taokenizer will understand this.  If you have text that does something
fancier, you will have to write your own tokenizer (replace token.l).
This is not that hard, and there is a special hook so that you can
pass the main tile routine a callback function to handle special
tokens that are not part of the tilizing tokens.
.LP
The rest of the options adjust parameters that affect the tokenizing
algorithm, and unfortunately are not currently documented.
