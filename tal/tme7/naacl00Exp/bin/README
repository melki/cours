This directory contains all the segmentation algorithms used in
the experiments. See "../data/experiment code.txt" for details
of the experiments conducted and the corresponding code.

All cited papers are included in the package whenever possible,
refer to the OPTannotate field for document name. The files can
be found in "../doc" directory.

All my algorithms have similar parameters, use "<program> -h" to
display help message.

--- ALGROTHMS ---
Segmenter1.6	- Min-Yen Kan et al.'s implementation of Segmenter (kan_et_al_1998)
		  with my own scripts to make the input and output compatible with
		  my evaluation software. Note! You'll need to change the paths in
		  all the original scripts to work. Can't do much about that, sorry.
		  This is a bare-minimum distribution of Kan's Segmenter, you'll
		  need his permission and license to get the full version. Don't
		  forget to install DB_FILE and Berkeley DB (took me a while to suss
		  that one out, duh!). Otherwise, Segmenter won't work (see
		  Segmenter1.6/README.txt)

Segmenter	- Script to invoke Segmenter as a pipe-friendly program. Don't
		  forget to change to install path for your local installation.
			
TextTile	- Marti Hearst's implementation of the TextTiling algorithm
		  (hearst_1994, hearst_1994b) with my own scripts to make the
		  input and output compatible with my evaluation software.

Tile		- Script to invoke TextTile as a pipe-friendly program. Don't
		  forget to change to install path for your local installation.

uk		- Java classes for all my algorithms

C99		- My C99 algorithm for linear text segmentation (choi_2000naacl)

JBeeferman	- My implementation of Beeferman's evaluation metric for linear segmentation
				  (beeferman_et_al_1997, beeferman_et_al_1999)

JBeefermanSim	- A simulation of four degenerate segmentation algorithms, refer to "../bin/public.batch"
		  and "../data/experiment code.txt" for details of the four algorithm types.

JDotPlot	- An exact implementation of Jeff Reynar's dotplotting algorithm (reynar_1994,
		  reynar_1998, reynar_1999)

JDotPlotB	- My block-based (less-memory intensive and more flexible) implementation of
		  Jeff Reynar's dotplotting algorithm (reynar_1994, reynar_1998, reynar_1999)

JDotPlotF	- A fully modularized and speed optimized version of DotPlotting for evaluating the
		  performance of various simularity metrics (choi_2000naacl, reynar_1994, reynar_1998,
		  reynar_1999). Refer to "../bin/public.batch" and "../data/experiment code.txt" for
		  details of the six algorithm types.

JPosServer	- A client/server POS tagger based on Oliver Mason's QTAG (mason_1998). This is used
		  by JSegmenter.

JSegmenter	- My implementation of Min-Yen Kan et al.'s Segmenter (kan_et_al_1998). Make sure you
		  get JPosServer running first. Use "rmiregistry 2000 &" and "JPosServer -r ../resource/QTAG.tagset &"
		  to start POS server, then run JSegmenter. Might encounter server address problems,
		  change local host name by modifying the field "rmiHost" in "uk/ac/man/cs/choif/extend/Resourcex.java".
		  Look at "ermintrude" and "doorstop" in "uk/ac/man/cs/choif/extend/RMIx.java" as examples of how to
		  define new hosts. Of course, you'll need to recompile Segmenter after that. Mail me if there are any
		  problems.

JSignificance	- Significance test for the results of all compatible experiment pairs. Use the following
		  commands to generate a table of statistical significance (assume you are in the current
		  directory) :
				
		  mkdir scores
		  cat `find ../data -name TestLog*` | ../ebin/public.extractScore -o scores
		  JSignificance -i scores -o significance.txt
		  rm -rf scores

JTextTile	- My Java implementation of Marti Hearst's TextTiling algorithm (hearst_1994, hearst_1994b)
		  Note. Use "JTextTile -sw ../resource/STOPWORD.list", see "JTextTile -h" for help.

simRegular	- A Perl baseline algorithm that proposes segment boundaries at regular intervals.
