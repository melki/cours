This directory contains Perl scripts for batch testing
segmentation algorithms.

--- REQUIREMENTS ---
The following external programs are required by the scripts

"perl"			- Perl 5 as /usr/bin/perl
"time"			- Linux command used in private.simulateOneCase and private.testOneCase
"java"			- JDK 1.1.7+ installed, I assume you have JDK up and running and classpaths are set
"rmiregistry"		- Part of JDK 1.1.7 for remote access

--- SCRIPTS ---
Of particular interest are the public. scripts. Make sure you read the description at the
beginning of each file before you execute them. Some of them might have nasty effects if the
correct set of arguments are not given.

NOTE! It is a good idea to run these scripts while you are in the current directory, I can't
guarantee what will happen otherwise (haven't tested other invokation methods). These scripts
are pretty dumb things, handle with care :-)

list.txt			- A list of Brown corpus files for use as the text sample pool
list (aj).txt			- Same as list.txt but only has c[aj]**.pos
public.batch			- Batch test algorithms
public.BatchAll			- Batch test algorithms on all data sets
public.SummaryAll		- Create a summary of all test data
public.testSimulate		- Test a baseline algorithm using a particular dataset. Adjust script for cases where certain sample type (e.g. 3-11) is not available.
public.testAlgorithm		- Test an algorithm using a particular dataset. Adjust script for cases where certain sample type (e.g. 3-11) is not available.
public.rename			- Rename the experiment code in a test log
public.makeSample		- Construct test samples
public.makeSummary		- Given the TestLog.txt file, generates Latex tables to summarise results
public.extractScore		- Given a test log, extract all the experiment scores as separate files
public.significance 		- Compute the statistical significance of the experiment results

--- DIRECTORIES ---
verify				- A verification of the testing scripts, commands :
						public.makeSample verify 2
						public.batch verify
				  A couple of hours later.......
						public.makeSummary < verify/TestLog.txt
				  Joy.
