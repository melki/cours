Do you want me to sit here ?
No, here is fine .
- You 're <START:person> Kristen Balko <END> ? - Yes .
And you 're VP of Information Security at <START:organization> Running Milk <END> ?
That 's right .
Um , is this part of the test ?
No, just the pre-test .
Think of this as a practice run .
We gather some background information , then go over the questions you 'll be asked .
You 're gonna tell me the questions on the test - before the test ?
- That 's right .
Is n't that cheating ?
Uh , no , it is n't like the movies , <START:person> Ms. Balko <END> .
There are no "gotcha moments " .
You 'll know every question beforehand .
Okay , got it .
Fire away .
Have you ever shared confidential materials with individuals not employed with <START:organization> Running Milk <END> ?
No, never .
Am I supposed to answer ?
Anything you want .
Have you ever stolen anything from your workplace ?
Never .
Have you ever lied to the company ?
No. 
I lied .
You did steal materials from the workplace ?
No, I lied by saying I never lied to the company .
Could you be more specific ?
When I applied , in my résumé I told them that I worked as a VP of Information Technology at a previous company .
But there was no VP of Information Technology .
- Oh , that 's it ?
- Yes , what do you mean ?
They fired you because you said you were a VP on your résumé ?
No, they fired me because I lied in the lie detector test .
But that was n't the point of the lie detector test , right ?
They were trying to find someone who stole - confidential materials .
- Right .
And you did n't do that .
Did you try to explain that to your boss ?
Yes , but they said I lied to the company , so they could fire me .
That 's why I 'm suing .
<START:location> Silicon Valley <END> 's a very provincial town .
I ca n't get a job anywhere .
Well , The Polygraph Protection Act keeps an employer from forcing you to take a lie detector test , but there are exceptions .
Theft .
Uh , <START:person> Kristen <END> , this is our investigator <START:person> Jason <END> .
Hi .
But I did n't steal anything .
Yes , but it was the reason for the polygraph .
They caught you in another lie , but ...
They need corroborating evidence .
Right .
And they could n't have fired her unless they already had some evidence that she lied on her résumé .
Did they , <START:person> Kristen <END> ?
Have evidence I lied ?
No, I do n't think so .
The whole point of the polygraph was about this theft .
Okay , um , why do n't you give us the day to think about it ?
Actually , I do n't have a day .
Mr. <START:person> Canning <END> told me you 'd be able to move faster than he could .
- <START:person> Louis Canning <END> ? - Yes .
He already filed the suit , but he got busy with another case , and he thought you 'd be good to take it over .
I 'm sure he did .
All right , I will see if they have any corroborating evidence .
Good , a polygraph ca n't be the sole basis for firing .
So what ... cap my work off at five hours ?
- Yeah . - Okay .
So , what did you find out about insurance ?
Oh , yeah .
Malpractice insurance is a fortune , but we could bundle it .
I can get a rider to your homeowner 's policy , and just split the increase in your premium ?
Will the coverage extend to <START:person> Jason <END> ?
No, he 's a freelancer .
I do n't think it 's a problem .
Did you know he used to be a lawyer ?
- No. - He practiced in <START:location> New Jersey <END> .
He was disbarred for a criminal conviction .
He punched a judge .
He punched a judge ?
- Yep. - Why ?
I guess he did n't like his decision .
And you 're worried about the insurance ?
Yeah , if <START:person> Jason <END> beats up someone on the job ... Yeah , well , due diligence .
We should find out what happened .
Okay , I 'm gonna call <START:location> New Jersey <END> .
See if I can talk to the judge .
What 's up , <START:person> Eli <END> ? What 's the best thing about <START:person> Peter <END> ?
Excuse me ?
I need a quote from you for <START:person> Peter <END> 's bio .
Do you need it to be true ?
True adjacent .
<START:person> Peter <END> 's motto is " Service above self .
My family has benefitted from it , now <START:location> America <END> can . "
<START:person> Eli <END> , that 's ...
I know , it 's nauseating .
Help me out .
<START:person> Eli <END> ?
Over here .
Just a second , <START:person> Alicia <END> .
I thought this was a staff meeting .
It is .
Turn off your cell phone and I 'll turn off mine .
- What is it ?
- An Alabama Slammer .
Yeah .
I like them strong .
Confusion to our enemies .
So , what are we discussing , <START:person> Ruth <END> ?
What makes <START:person> Eli Gold <END> tick ?
Uh , I know how this works , <START:person> Ruth <END> .
Unless you 're trying to seduce me , which I very much doubt , you get me drunk , you pretend to be drunk and you find out more about me than I find out about you .
Oh , <START:person> Eli <END> , you 're too suspicious .
You 're a new tree in my forest .
I want to know more about that tree , that 's all .
Because unless I chop it down , that tree 's now part of my life .
- So... - My grandfather , <START:person> Samuel Gold <END> , was a teamster organizer in <START:location> Brooklyn <END> .
Everything I learned , I learned from him .
I remember going to visit him in his office when I was little .
All the people coming to kiss his ring .
Looking for advice , for help .
And he told me that the most powerful men are the ones that no one knows exist .
Is something funny ?
- Oh , yeah .
- What ? None of that was true .
Your grandfather was <START:person> Ira Goldstein <END> , owner of a schmatta business in <START:location> Queens <END> .
He died a pauper after his brother-in-law cheated him out of a uniform consignment with the <START:organization> NYPD <END>.
And that quote ?
You changed it .
It 's from The Usual Suspects .
So , what do you want , <START:person> Ruth <END> ?
Why are you pretending to care about me ?
We got new internals from this afternoon .
<START:person> Peter <END> made another four point bump .
That 's more than a fluke , that 's a trend .
We broke through .
We have a shot .
And not just at the vice presidency .
We could win .
Things turn sour for <START:person> Hillary <END> ... the e-mails , the next thing they throw at her ... we win .
But we need to be rowing in the same direction .
This goes the way we all want , they 'll be enough to carve up for both of us .
- You see that , right ?
- I do .
So the strategy 's changed .
We 're not being kind and deferential to the frontrunner .
We 're acting like the frontrunner .
We 're not aiming for the vice presidency .
We 're aiming for the presidency .
So , what do you need from me ? We 're moving up the announcement to Thursday .
We want to take advantage of the momentum .
You need <START:person> Alicia <END> ?
Yes , much more than we originally agreed .
Voters need to see these two together .
Young , vibrant , looking toward the future .
<START:person> Jackie O <END> to his <START:person> JFK <END>.
We need to work together , <START:person> Eli <END> .
You need to trust me .
And I need to trust you .
Who 's that ?
I do n't know .
<START:location> Silicon Valley <END> lawyer ?
- Hello .
<START:person> Alice Florrick <END> , yes ? - Yes . <START:person> Andrea Stevens <END> .
It 's so nice to meet you .
I was told you were the opposing counsel .
It just makes it so much more exciting when you respect the opposition , do n't you think ? - It does .
- Hello .
Hi .
<START:person> Lucca Quinn <END> .
Hi .
I love your hair .
How many years are you out of law school , <START:person> Lucca <END> ?
A few .
Well , that 's better than less than a few .
All rise .
- Oh , here we go .
- Court is now in session .
<START:person> Lucca <END> , if you ever want any advice .
Good afternoon .
I 've read your preliminary motions .
I would like to take up the , uh , jurisdictional question .
Your Honor , the plaintiff lives in <START:location> Chicago <END> ... Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !
Your Honor , I was warned about <START:location> Chicago <END> courtrooms , but I did n't think it was gonna be about who shouted the loudest .
It is n't , Counselor .
What do you have ?
Thank you , Your Honor .
This is rank forum shopping .
<START:person> Mrs. Florrick <END> knows this case belongs in <START:location> California <END> .
<START:organization> Running Milk <END> has no <START:location> Chicago <END> offices .
And the lie detector test in question took place in <START:location> California <END> .
<START:person> Kristen Balko <END> lives in <START:location> Chicago <END> .
And thanks to the cloud tax passed by the <START:organization> Chicago City Council <END> , <START:organization> Running Milk <END> 's offices are both in <START:location> California <END> and <START:location> Illinois <END> .
Yes , but respectfully , Your Honor , they are not physically in <START:location> Illinois <END> .
But as <START:organization> Running Milk <END> and its ilk have constantly reminded us : " Brick and mortar are things of the past .
The cloud is the future . "
Your Honor , so many of our witnesses will have to be flown in from <START:location> San Jose <END> and that does n't ...
And so many of our witnesses will have - to be flown in from <START:location> Chicago <END> ... - Your Honor , to refute these ... Thank you .
But as Ms. <START:person> Stevens <END> pointed out , this should n't be about who shouts the loudest .
Motion is denied .
We 'll hear the case here .
Please have the <START:organization> Running Milk <END> software spec sent to me by end of day , thank you .
Just the first skirmish .
_ - <START:person> Peter <END> wants to be president .
- Excuse me ?
<START:person> Peter <END> thinks he can be president .
I need a drink .
Do you want one ?
No, I need to go .
They moved the announcement up to Thursday .
You need to be in <START:location> Springfield <END> .
I wrote you a speech ; very <START:person> Michelle Obama <END> .
- What time Thursday ?
- 3:00 p.m. They 'll need us more than usual .
They keep mixing their metaphors .
You 're either <START:person> Michelle Obama <END> or <START:person> Jackie O. <END> Do you ever wonder why I 'm hearing this from you and not <START:person> Peter <END> ?
What ?
No. What do you mean ?
Well , I 'm hearing that <START:person> Peter <END> truly is running for president and that I might be First Lady from his campaign manager .
I am not his campaign manager .
You think he has a chance ?
I do n't know .
I thought <START:person> Trump <END> would self-destruct , so what do I know ?
Primaries are their own insanity .
What are you making ?
A margarita .
Tequila , triple sec.
Huh . - You judging me ? - No.
That sounded like a judgmental huh .
No. 
You get as sloppy drunk as you want to .
So , what do they want me to do ? Be involved .
Go on Thursday .
Give a good speech .
Look First Lady-like .
I got <START:person> Frank Landau <END> to introduce you .
It 's not bad having the head of the Democratic committee say nice things about you .
What are you doing , <START:person> Eli <END> ?
This does n't sound like you .
Sure it does .
This is what I sound like .
No, no , no , no .
You 're scheming something here .
Cheers .
Hey , I 've got some good news and I got some bad news ... which do you want first ?
- Bad . - Good .
<START:organization> Running Milk <END> 's HR team definitely verified - <START:person> Kristen <END> lied on her résumé .
- Damn . - So we have no case .
- What 's the good news ?
I do n't think there was a theft at <START:organization> Running Milk <END> .
What do you mean ?
A firm like <START:organization> Running Milk <END> is required to notify their customers of any breach ; they did n't .
<START:location> California <END> attorney general 's got no record of any breach at <START:organization> Running Milk <END> .
So they had no reason to polygraph .
Right , fruit of the poisonous tree .
Why 'd you punch that judge ?
I was angry .
Why were you angry ?
Do n't you get angry ?
I do , but I do n't punch people .
Maybe you should start .
As you can see , Your Honor , <START:organization> Running Milk <END> never suffered a security breach , and since that was the only legal justification for polygraphing our client , - that polygraph must be thrown out .
- Is this true ?
Can you give me one second , Your Honor ?
As you requested , uh , the CEO of <START:organization> Running Milk <END> flew in a great personal expense .
I 'm honored .
Without admitting to any wrongdoing , Your Honor , <START:organization> Running Milk <END> generously agrees to rehire the plaintiff at her original salary .
We just want this to be over .
- Really ?
Since when ? - Since an hour ago .
We ask that this suit be dismissed , Your Honor .
Your Honor , if our client is rehired , she ca n't be subjected to a new polygraph , is that correct ?
Yes , private employers are barred from making polygraphs a condition of employment .
May we have a ruling on that , Your Honor ?
Um , can ... I 'm-I 'm sorry , can I just have one more second , Your Honor ?
Actually , polygraphs may be applied to employees engaged in counterintelligence or national security functions , pursuant to a contract with the federal government .
Your Honor , our client has no connection with national security .
And again I ask for a ruling .
These contracts show that <START:organization> Running Milk <END> has ongoing accounts with the government .
This makes no sense .
If these contracts were the reason for these polygraph tests , then why create the fiction of a security breach ?
Are we really wondering why the <START:organization> National Security Agency <END> might have a need for secrecy ?
Your Honor , the defendant just plans to rehire our client so they can fire her again .
Yes , but legally .
These contracts appear in order .
Before <START:person> Miss Balko <END> starts work again , she 'll need to submit to a polygraph .
Your Honor .
I do n't have time for this , <START:person> Eli <END> .
Even for a friend ?
If you 're wearing a wire , you have to tell me , or it 'll be thrown out in court .
I am not wearing a wire .
I need your help .
I would never have taken that bribe .
I did n't need you to warn me .
But I did warn you .
What ?
What do you need ?
Information on <START:person> Frank Landau <END> and his manipulation of voting machines in the last election .
- No, I wo n't betray him .
- He wo n't know it 's you .
I just need the proof from you , and I 'll do the rest .
What are you up to ?
