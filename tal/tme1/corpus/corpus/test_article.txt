Mark Zuckerberg Will Take 2 Months of Paternity Leave


Mark Zuckerberg announced on Facebook Friday that he plans to take two months of paid maternity leave when his daughter arrives.

Zuckerberg's wife Priscilla Chan is pregnant with the couple's first child, and her due date has not been revealed. But if the toys posted on Zuckerberg's Facebook page is any indication, the baby could be arriving sometime soon.

"We've also been thinking about how we're going to take time off during the first months of her life," he wrote in a post accompanying some photos of baby gear. "This is a very personal decision, and I've decided to take 2 months of paternity leave when our daughter arrives."

"Studies show that when working parents take time to be with their newborns, outcomes are better for the children and families," he wrote. Facebook offers U.S. employees up to 4 months of paid maternity or paternity leave which they can take throughout the year.

Zuckerberg did not mention whether he plans to take his remaining two months at a later date. Zuckerberg and Chan announced on Facebook in late July that they were expecting.
